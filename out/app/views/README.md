Here are all templates stored which are used by client and server as a rout template or a component template.

Templates on server side are always used as a rout template because at the moment it is not possible to render web components on server side.

Templates on client side can be used as a rout template and as a component template. This is possible because we are using nunjucks. For more information see: <https://mozilla.github.io/nunjucks/>

Note that component templates must have only one root element!

This directory will be hard linked into the corresponding area in sources.
