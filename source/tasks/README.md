# Tasks

Here are source files of tasks stored. Write only a task if it is **really** useful and necessary.

Tasks are written with Grunt. For more information see: <https://gruntjs.com/getting-started>

Please write every test in a typescript file to have secure typings in your code and name the test file \<name>.task.ts.

Grunt is configured by the [gruntfile.js](./../../gruntfile.js) in the root directory.
