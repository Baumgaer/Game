# Tests

Here are source files of tests stored. Write for every function a separate test using **mocha**. For more information see: <https://mochajs.org/#getting-started>

Please write every test in a typescript file to have secure typings in your code and name the test file \<name>.spec.ts.

Mocha is configured by the [mocha.opts](./../../mocha.opts) file in the root.
